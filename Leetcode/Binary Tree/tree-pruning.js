//https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/

// We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

// Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

// (Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

// Example 1:
// Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
// Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
